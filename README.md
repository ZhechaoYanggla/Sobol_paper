  Mathematical models of cardiac cell electrical activity include
  numerous parameters, making calibration to experimental data and
  individual-specific modeling challenging. This study applies Sobol
  sensitivity analysis, a global variance-decomposition method, to identify
  the most influential parameters in the Shannon model of rabbit
  ventricular myocyte action potential (AP). The analysis highlights
  the background chlorine current ($I_\text{Clb}$) as the dominant determinant
  of AP variability. Additionally, the inward rectifier potassium
  current ($I_\text{K1}$), fast/slow delayed rectifier potassium
  currents ($I_\text{Kr}$, $I_\text{Ks}$), sodium-calcium exchanger
  current ($I_\text{NaCa}$), the slow component of the transient
  outward potassium current ($I_\text{tos}$), and L-type calcium
  current ($I_\text{CaL}$) significantly affect AP biomarkers, including
  duration, plateau potential, and resting potential. Confidence
  intervals from bootstrapping validate the robustness of these
  results. Exploiting these results, a hierarchical reduction of the
  model is performed and  demonstrates that retaining only six key
  parameters can sufficiently   capture individual biomarkers, with a
  coefficient of determination   exceeding 0.9 for selected
  cases. These findings improve the   utility of the   Shannon model
  for personalized simulations, aiding   applications like   digital
  twins and drug response predictions in   biomedical research.
